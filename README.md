# AI-Powered Food Waste Reduction System

## Overview
This project focuses on reducing food waste by accurately forecasting meal demand
using machine learning. By predicting the required quantity of food in advance,
the system helps organizations optimize procurement, reduce wastage, and cut costs.

The solution combines an XGBoost regression model with an interactive Streamlit
dashboard for real-time visualization and decision support.

## Problem Statement
Overproduction of food leads to significant waste and financial loss in
institutions such as hostels, cafeterias, and event catering services.
Accurate demand forecasting can help address this issue effectively.

## Tech Stack
- Programming Language: Python  
- Machine Learning: XGBoost  
- Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy  
- Visualization & UI: Streamlit  
- Model Evaluation: Scikit-learn

## How to Run the Project
1. Install dependencies:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
      
2. Run the Streamlit app:
   - streamlit run app.py
